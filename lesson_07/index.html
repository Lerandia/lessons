              <!-- <h3 class="subtitle">Abstract Backgrounds</h3> -->
              <p>
                Our abstract SVGs are constructed of simplified shapes,
                colors, marks, and elements that don't reflect reality. These
                clean and unobtrusive abstract designs are ideal backgrounds
                that support content in the foreground, such as text. You can
                change the colors to match your brand with the click of a
                button.
              </p>
              <!-- <h3 class="subtitle">Patterns</h3> -->
              <p>
                Our large collection of seamless and repeating pattern
                backgrounds is diverse and customizable. Manipulate the scale,
                orientation, opacity, as well as various properties of the
                pattern tiles or elements to create unique pattern variations.
                These SVGs come in a slew of styles, from classic, minimal,
                and geometric to hand-drawn patterns that add a ton of
                character.
              </p>
              <!-- <h3 class="subtitle">Geometric Backgrounds</h3> -->
              <p>
                Our geometric background collection features designs with
                distinct shapes, such as circles, squares, rectangles,
                triangles, hexagons, etc. in succinct formations. Backgrounds
                are often divided by lines, angles, curves, and space,
                creating complex shapes or patterns with various
                mathematically calculated geometries.
              </p>
              <!-- <h3 class="subtitle">Gradient Backgrounds</h3> -->
              <p>
                There are two types of SVG gradients: linear and radial. Our
                collection of gradient backgrounds mixes elements with
                gradients to achieve complex background designs. There is an
                assortment of colorful and complex gradients, achieved by
                overlapping multiple gradients with strategically placed
                transparency.
              </p>
              <!-- <h3 class="subtitle">Flat Gradient Backgrounds</h3> -->
              <p>
                A flat gradient is a segmented blend of colors achieved by a
                handful of color iterations, rather than a smooth blend
                consisting of hundreds of in-between colors. Our SVG
                backgrounds that use flat-gradients are subtle yet colorful
                and move the viewerâ€™s eye to focal points around the design.
              </p>
              <!-- <h3 class="subtitle">Line Art Backgrounds</h3> -->
              <p>
                This series of backgrounds is an exploration of lines, angles,
                and positioning. Line art can also apply to the outline of
                various shapes, opening a boat-load of possibilities. These
                designs rely heavily on strokes and you can manipulate the
                thickness of lines, aka stroke-width, in addition to colors
                and other SVG attributes.
